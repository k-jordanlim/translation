This User Agreement is set forth on the respective content page on this website, or has been made available to you personally, as the case may be. In the event of a conflict between the provisions of such promotions, bonuses, and special offers, and the provisions of this User Agreement, the provisions of such promotions, bonuses, and special offers will prevail.<br/><br/>5.8. We may insist that you bet a certain amount of your own deposit before you can bet with any free/bonus funds we credit to your account.<br/><br/>5.9. You accept that certain promotions may be subject to Withdraw restrictions and/or requirements that need to be met before funds credited under the promotion can be withdrawn.

This User Agreement is set forth on the respective content page on this website, or has been made available to you personally, as the case may be. In the event of a conflict between the provisions of such promotions, bonuses, and special offers, and the provisions of this User Agreement, the provisions of such promotions, bonuses, and special offers will prevail.<br/><br/>5.8. We may insist that you bet a certain amount of your own deposit before you can bet with any free/bonus funds we credit to your account.<br/><br/>5.9. You accept that certain promotions may be subject to Withdraw restrictions and/or requirements that need to be met before funds credited under the promotion can be withdrawn. Such terms shall be duly published and made available as part of the promotion.
